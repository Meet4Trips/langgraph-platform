   3. Structure the document with these sections:
      # Trip Overview
      ## Daily Itinerary (see 2.1)

   4. Error Handling:
      - If any section is missing information, note it as "Information pending"
      - If an agent's response is invalid or empty, skip that section
      - Always ensure the document is valid markdown
      - Never include raw error messages or invalid content

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Always ensure each agent's response is properly formatted and complete
- If an agent fails to provide a valid response, retry the request
- Never return empty or malformed responses
- Always validate the final output before sending it to the user
- If you encounter any errors, provide a clear error message and suggest next steps
- When an agent indicates they're not responsible, handle it gracefully by routing to the correct agent
- Keep track of which agents have been consulted to avoid redundant requests
- Ensure the final markdown document is well-structured and visually appealing
- Include all relevant information from each agent in the appropriate sections
- If any section is missing information, note it as "Information pending"
- Never include raw error messages or invalid content in the final document""",
